# omise_flutter

**omise_flutter** is a Flutter plugin for integrating Omise's payment API. This package provides a user-friendly interface for handling tokenization, payment authorization, and other payment-related functionalities directly in Flutter applications.

## Features

- Built in UI components.
- Direct integration with Omise's payment gateway in Flutter apps.
- Easy-to-use tokenization and authorization flows.
- Easy-to-use source creation flows.
- Built-in support for common error handling in payment processing.
- Internationalization support for : en, th and ja.

## Breaking Change - Library Rewrite

The `omise_flutter` library has undergone a complete rewrite in version `0.2.0`. This major update introduces significant changes to the API and architecture, which are **not backwards compatible** with previous versions (`0.1.x` and earlier).

### Key Changes:

- **API Overhaul**: All existing APIs from the `0.1.x` series have been removed. The API is now more streamlined and easier to use.
- **New UI Components**: The new version comes with built-in UI components for payment processing, providing a more user-friendly experience.
- **Source Creation**: Added seamless support for source creation like `promptpay` and `mobile_banking`.
- **Internationalization**: The library now supports English, Thai, and Japanese out of the box.
- **Debugging & Error Handling**: Added enhanced debugging options and better error handling for payment flows.

### Migration Notes:

If you were using version `0.1.x` or earlier, you will need to update your code to align with the new API as it has been completely rewritten.

## Getting Started

To use the package, add it to your project by including the following in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  omise_flutter: ^0.2.0
```

Run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

You will also need an Omise account and public/private keys, which you can obtain by signing up at the [Omise Dashboard](https://dashboard.omise.co).

## Usage

Here's an example of how to create a token or source using **omise_flutter**:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:omise_flutter/omise_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Omise Flutter Example',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

// State class for MyHomePage that handles payment actions
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // Omise payment instance, replace "pkey" with your actual Omise public key
  final omisePayment = OmisePayment(publicKey: "pkey", enableDebug: true, locale: OmiseLocale.en);

  // Opens a page to select payment methods and handle token creation
  Future<void> _openPaymentMethodsPage() async {
    final OmisePaymentResult? omisePaymentResult =
        await Navigator.push<OmisePaymentResult>(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) =>
              omisePayment.selectPaymentMethod(
               selectedPaymentMethods: [PaymentMethodName.card],
               selectedTokenizationMethod:[TokenizationMethod.googlepay],
                amount: 1000,
                currency: Currency.thb,
                // Google pay parameters
                googleMerchantId: 'googleMerchantId',
                requestBillingAddress: true,
                requestPhoneNumber: true,
                googlePayCardBrands: ['VISA'],
                googlePayEnvironment: 'TEST',
                googlePayItemDescription: "test description",
              )),
    );

    // Check if payment result is available
    if (omisePaymentResult == null) {
      log('No payment'); // Logs if no payment was made
    } else {
      // Logs token ID if available
      if (omisePaymentResult.token != null) {
        log(omisePaymentResult.token!.id);
      }
      // Other payment results (like source creation) can be handled here
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                _openPaymentMethodsPage(); // Button triggers payment method selection
              },
              style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30.0),
                ),
                padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(
                    horizontal: 32.0, vertical: 12.0),
              ),
              child: const Text('Choose payment method'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Google Pay

To start using google pay you must first obtain your google merchant id. If you are just planning to use test mode
you can skip this step until your integration is complete.
You can access the google pay screen from the main `selectPaymentMethod` widget or you can directly open the google pay screen using the following widget:

```dart
Future<void> _openGooglePayPage() async {
    final OmisePaymentResult? omisePaymentResult =
        await Navigator.push<OmisePaymentResult>(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => omisePayment.buildGooglePayPage(
                amount: 1000,
                currency: Currency.thb,
                googleMerchantId: 'googleMerchantId',
                requestBillingAddress: true,
                requestPhoneNumber: true,
                googlePayCardBrands: ['VISA'],
                googlePayEnvironment: 'TEST',
                googlePayItemDescription: "test description",
              )),
    );

    // Check if payment result is available
    if (omisePaymentResult == null) {
      log('No payment'); // Logs if no payment was made
    } else {
      // Logs token ID if available
      if (omisePaymentResult.token != null) {
        log(omisePaymentResult.token!.id);
      }
    }
  }

```
